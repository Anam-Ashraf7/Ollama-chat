# Ollama Chat

This repository houses the development of a chat UI designed specifically for [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), a powerful app to run large language model (LLM) capable of engaging in natural conversations on your device. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to use Ollama effectively rather than relying on the command line interface.
